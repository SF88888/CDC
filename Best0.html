The enthusiasm of Chengdu people has also caused the highly developed Chengdu catering industry. When it comes to Chengdu, it does not eat food, and people always have the feeling of returning to Baoshan empty-handed. There are many foods in Chengdu, such as hot pot, snacks, skewers, and Sichuan cuisine.</p>

                	<p class="color-1 p2">Chengdu has a long and unique historical origin, and its cultural heritage is extremely profound. As early as about 4,500 to 3,700 years ago, the Chengdu Plain has seen a series of settlement centers of ancient ancestors known as "Bao Dun Culture". These settlement centers have built walls and built places for sacrifices and gatherings. According to the large number of historical relics unearthed from the “Golden Sands Site”, it can be presumed that, at the latest, from the late Shang Dynasty to the early Western Zhou Dynasty, Chengdu’s area has become the center of the ancient Shu Kingdom; and the discovery of the burial group of the Warring States ship in Chengdu Commercial Street It is further proved that at the latest in the early Warring States period, the center of the Chengdu-Chongqing metropolitan area may already have a relatively standard classical city, and it is very likely that it is the capital of the ancient dynasty, the last dynasty of the ancient dynasty. In 316 BC, the Qin dynasty, set up the county with its place, set up Chengdu County in the old capital of the king, and was the county governor. In 311 BC, Zhang Jun, who was in the capital of Chengdu, built a large city and a small city in Chengdu. The city regulation was modeled after the Qin Dynasty. This major event was recognized by the later generations as the symbol of Chengdu's construction of the city. Since then, the county governor Li Bing presided over the construction of the Dujiangyan water conservancy project on the basis of the water management of the monks. Dujiangyan created the Chengdu Plain into a rich "land of abundance" and laid a material foundation for the development of Chengdu City, making Chengdu quickly become the economic, political and cultural center of the Southwest. Since the Qin Dynasty was built as a great city for more than 2000 years, the Chengdu city has been destroyed or rebuilt, or expanded, and the city has never migrated. The name “Chengdu” has never changed, and it is unique among many historical and cultural cities in China.</p>

Chengdu city attractions are more concentrated, you can visit around 1-2 days. The best spots are scattered around the area, and it is more appropriate to arrange 2-4 days. Dujiangyan and Qingcheng Mountain are not to be missed, and it usually takes 2-3 days to play.</p>
